# Passwords

Passwords are essential to securing our digital lives, yet many users still choose weak, predictable ones. As [<em>(The Economist, 2012)</em>](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2012/03/24/speak-friend-and-enter) points out, even tech-savvy individuals often prioritise convenience over security. Worse still, password reuse across multiple accounts means a single breach can compromise an entire digital footprint.

To address this issue, this repository offers two key tools:

- ***password_generator()***: A customisable function that generates a password based on user-specified criteria: *length of password, character types (uppercase, digits, symbols)*. 

- ***cracking_time()***: A function which estimates how long a hacker would take to crack a given password using common attack methods, such as brute-force.
